# Syracuse University Premier League Football Analysis
## Project Description
Football, being one of the most popular sports globally, serves as a unifying force among people. In our project for IST 652 - Scripting for Data Analysis, we focus on analyzing data from the English Premier League, spanning from the 2009/2010 season to the 2021/2022 season. Our primary objective is to delve into the performance of the top six English Premier League teams: Tottenham Hotspur, Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, and Arsenal. By examining game statistics and comparing performances among these teams, we aim to gain insights into their success factors and competitive dynamics.

## Data Analysis Objectives
Our dataset, sourced from football-data.co.uk, comprises fixture details and results for each season, including statistics such as goals scored, shots on target, fouls committed, and more. With this rich dataset, we seek to achieve the following objectives:

Analyze each team's success over the years and identify contributing factors.
Explore correlations between game statistics (e.g., shots on target, corner kicks) and team performance.
Investigate the influence of home-field advantage on a team's win percentage.
Aditionally, analyze the 15/16 season where a non big 6 club won the league.

## Conclusion
After analyzing the statistics presented, it became evident that the provided data alone is insufficient to ascertain the key traits that determine a team's likelihood of winning. Further research is warranted to explore additional game-affecting characteristics, such as possession rates, ball pass accuracy among teams, and the efficacy of successful tackling as a tactical approach during matches. Additionally, investigating the impact of substantial financial investments in teams on their performance and win records presents another avenue for potential study. By delving deeper into these areas, a more comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing team success in football can be attained.
